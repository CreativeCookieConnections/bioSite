    <h2> Personal Goals </h2>
  <p>Ari is now a wonderful 3-year-old girl with a heart meant for learning, adventure, and lots of love. She is passionate about education, playing, and spending quality time with family. Ari spends a lot of time with her family and enjoys spending time with each of them. The family collaborates to help with her informal education, learning new things, fundamental skills, and manners. When Ari first turned 3 years old, the family started seeking information about formal education. Since Ari liked learning so much, it was time to consider preschool. When Ari and her mother went to the local school, they signed up for a program called Parents Be Teachers. The program allowed for school visits to a teacher, and thus the parent and child will learn basic, essential skills, activities, and knowledge to prepare for preschool and kindergarten. The program was also great for general child development, enhancing critical thinking, and fostering self-regulation. Ari enjoyed this program and was always excited to attend school to meet with the teacher, wearing her cute little backpack. The family got Ari signed up for preschool, and she got approved for the summer of 2025. Now, Ari has a few goals to help her further develop her skills, knowledge, and abilities. These goals are: attending preschool, making friends, developing social skills, and learning how to follow directions from the teacher. These goals are essential because Ari can unlock plenty of benefits, such as enhanced social, emotional, and cognitive development, which can prepare her for kindergarten.</p>
