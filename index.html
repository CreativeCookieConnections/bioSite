    <p>Ari is a wonderful 3 year old girl with a heart meant for learning, adventure, and lots of love. She is passionate about education, playing, and spending quality time with family. The family collaborates together to help with her informal education, learning new things, basic skills, and manners. When Ari first turned 3 years old, the family started seeking information about formal education. Since Ari liked learning so much, it was time to consider preschool. When going to the local school, Ari and her mother, signed up for a program called Parents be Teachers. The program allowed for school visits to a teacher, and thus the parent and child will learn basic important skills, activities, and knowledge to prepare for preschool, and kindergarten. The program was also great for general child development, enhancing critical thinking, and fostering self-regulation. Ari really enjoyed this program, and was always excited to go to school to meet with the teacher while wearing her cute little backpack. The family got Ari signed up for preschool, and she got approved the summer of 2025. Now, Ari has a few goals to help her further develop her skills, knowledge, and abilities. These goals are; go to preschool, make friends, build social skills, and learn how to follow directions from the teacher. These goals are important, because Ari is able to unlock plenty of benefits such as enhanced social, emotional, and cognitive development which can prepare her for kindergarten.</p>

  <h1> Personal Goals </h1>

  <p> Ari is almost 4 years old, and got accepted to go to preschool. At 3 years old, Ari began a program with her mother, Aisha, called Parents be Teachers. The program allows the parent to work with her child and a teacher to further implement important tasks that can be used for proper child development. Ari really liked the Parents be Teacher meetings, for she would get to play games, play with the toys, learn new things, get to know the teacher, and earn a gift to take home. Ari liked going to the school for the meetings, and would often take a little backpack with her. She likes school a lot, which makes one of her major personal goals to start preschool in August. </p>
