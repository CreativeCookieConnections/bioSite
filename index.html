  <h1> Personal Goals </h1>
  <img src="images/ari-personal-goal-picture.jpg" alt="illustration of a star saying super star, a bumblebee saying smart as can bee, and a photo of a little girl">
  <p> Ari is almost 4 years old, and got accepted to go to preschool. At 3 years old, Ari began a program with her mother, Aisha, called Parents be Teachers. The program allows the parent to work with her child and a teacher to further implement important tasks that can be used for proper child development. Ari really liked the Parents be Teacher meetings, for she would get to play games, play with the toys, learn new things, get to know the teacher, and earn a gift to take home. Ari liked going to the school for the meetings, and would often take a little backpack with her. She likes school a lot, which makes one of her major personal goals to start preschool in August. </p>
