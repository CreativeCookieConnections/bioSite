  <h2>Ari Bio</h2>
  <img src="images/ari-profile.png" alt="picture of a smiling little girl with a blue background" class="image3">
  <p>Ari was born on August 15, 2025, at the Western Missouri Medical Center in Missouri, on a Sunday. From the very start, she was a sweet baby who enjoyed eating, sleeping, and spending time with her family. As she developed to open her eyes very quickly, she began to take in the world and claim it as her own. Due to her fresh start, she was able to take control and demand anything she needed within seconds. Her mother, Aisha, worked to ensure Ari was fully taken care of and that all her needs were being met. Which, in turn, contributed to the growth and development of Ari Fatimalee Keller.</p>
  <p>Between the ages of 1 and 3, Ari has been grasping the world around her with great interest, developing essential skills, inspirations, and hobbies. Her amazing-ness truly starts with her heart, mind, and courage. The most significant component of Ari's life is her family, which consists of her mother, auntie, Mima, and Papa. Together, the family are Ari's biggest cheerleaders, who aid in further developing essential milestones, skills, interests, manners, and knowledge. The family highly enjoys Ari being around, and they never leave a day without saying, "I love you, Peanut." The love and care that the family brings to Ari helps shape her into who she is today, as well as developing exciting goals for the future.</p>
  <p>Ari, with the help of family, can make the most out of her days to help her achieve essential milestones. Trying different foods, accepting new tumblers and cups, watching educational content on the tablet, engaging in creative and simple activities, and going out into town are all ways the family helps Ari reach her milestones.  Doing a variety of different things has helped Ari achieve various skills such as counting, identifying shapes, identifying colors, understanding emotions, being potty trained in and out of the house, identifying Pokémon, having a favorite color, and more.  Ari is becoming increasingly smarter each day, thanks to the knowledge she gains from those around her.</p>
  <p>Ari has many favorite activities that she enjoys while at home or out in town. At home, Ari likes to spend time with her family, run around, swim in the pool, watch the horses, play with the dogs, and engage in active learning on her tablet. Ari is particularly fond of learning new things, so she often watches educational content on her tablet, which helps further develop her skills, emotions, abilities, and knowledge. Out of the house, Ari likes to go grocery shopping, get a McDonald's Kids Meal, go to the indoor playground, go to the outdoor playground, visit the library, get a donut at Yummy's Donut Palace, go to school programs for parents and their children, and do some toy shopping. Ari also enjoys attending events that feature amusement rides.</p>
